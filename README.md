SC6101 Term Paper

You will conduct a literature survey on blockchain Security, Privacy and Scalability issues. The main tasks for the Term Paper will be to:
Pick a sample blockchain use case (i.e., a Decentralized Application) and argue which one of the three issues -- Security, Privacy, Scalability -- concerns the most in the case of your chosen Decentralized Application.
Perform a brief literature survey on the issue that you have chosen above, and identify the major considerations in your chosen application.
Analyze the major considerations you identified above in terms of their impact (and ramifications) on your chosen application.
Propose strategies and mechanisms (may be from existing literature, or your own) to address the major concerns you have identified.
This Term Paper is a group project, with at most 6 students.
